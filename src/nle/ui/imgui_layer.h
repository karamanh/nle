 * @brief Owns the imgui context and runs one frame of it.
 *
 * Tools built on the engine need a real interface -- panels, fields, text --
 * and imgui is already linked. This is the whole integration: construct one,
 * draw between begin_frame() and end_frame() from window::render_ui(), and
 * let it go out of scope to shut down.
 *
 *     nle::imgui_layer ui(app.window());
 *
 *     app.window()->render_ui() = [&]() {
 *         ui.begin_frame();
 *         ImGui::Begin("Tools");
 *         ...
 *         ImGui::End();
 *         ui.end_frame();
 *     };
 *
 * Only one of these may exist at a time, since the imgui context is global.
 *
 * wants_mouse() and wants_keyboard() are what keep a tool from acting on input
 * that the interface has already taken: a click that lands on a panel must not
 * also place something in the world behind it.
