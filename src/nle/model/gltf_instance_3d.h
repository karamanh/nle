/**
 * @brief An instance of a model_gltf, with its own animation playback state.
 *
 * Geometry, materials and the rig are shared with the model; the pose is not,
 * so two instances of the same model can play different clips at different
 * points in time.
 *
 * Playback is advanced from render(), using the frame's delta time, so an
 * instance animates simply by being in a scene:
 *
 *     auto knight = model->create_gltf_instance();
 *     knight->animator()->play("walk");
 *     scene->add_child(knight);
 *
 * A consequence worth knowing: an instance that is culled, hidden or on a
 * disabled layer is not rendered and therefore does not advance. Drive
 * animator()->update() yourself if you need it to keep time regardless.
