/**
 * @file audio.h
 * @brief Sound out of the machine, and one piece of music at a time.
 *
 * A game wants a theme that starts when you walk into a town and is gone by
 * the time you are fighting something. That is two questions -- what should
 * be sounding, and how loudly -- and only the second one is continuous, so
 * this keeps them apart: ask for a track and it takes care of handing over
 * from whatever was playing, and set the volume every frame if you like.
 *
 * Why one track: the mixer underneath plays a single music stream, so a true
 * crossfade is not on offer. What happens instead is a fall to silence and a
 * rise back out of it, which is what a change of place sounds like anyway.
 *
 * Volume is this class's alone. The mixer's own fade helpers are not used,
 * because they fight with anything that sets the volume while they run, and
 * the whole point here is that the game sets the volume while they run.
 *
 * Built without a device, or built on a machine with no mixer at all, every
 * call is a no-op and ready() says so. Silence is a perfectly good outcome;
 * refusing to start is not.
