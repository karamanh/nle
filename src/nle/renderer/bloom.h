/**
 * @brief Draws the scene into a buffer, then blooms it onto the screen.
 *
 * The scene goes into a floating point target rather than straight to the
 * window, which is the point: a torch at seven times intensity is brighter
 * than white, and a normal target would have thrown that away before anything
 * could notice. Pixels above a threshold are taken out, blurred, and added
 * back.
 *
 * The blur runs at half resolution. Bloom is a wide, soft thing, so the
 * missing detail is not visible, and it is four times cheaper.
 *
 * Drop-in: if the buffers cannot be made, begin() says so and the caller
 * draws to the window as it did before.
 *
 *     if(!bloom.begin(width, height)) { glViewport(...); glClear(...); }
 *     ... draw the scene ...
