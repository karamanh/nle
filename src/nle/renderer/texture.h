/**
 * @brief How a picture is sampled when it is smaller on screen than on disk.
 *
 * crisp keeps one texel one texel. It is what a palette belongs in: the
 * character packs paint a whole model from a picture a few dozen pixels
 * across, where the skin and the robe are neighbouring texels, and anything
 * that blends between texels blends the robe onto the face. Which is exactly
 * what happened the day this was not a choice.
 *
 * smooth uses the mipmaps, and is what anything tiled across a landscape
 * wants: with a texture repeating two hundred times, one screen pixel covers
 * many texels, and picking one of them at random is a surface that boils as
 * the camera moves.
