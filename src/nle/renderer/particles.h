/**
 * @file particles.h
 * @brief A great many small bright things, simulated entirely on the GPU.
 *
 * Stateless, which is the whole design: a particle's position, size and
 * colour are a pure function of its index and the clock. Nothing is stored
 * between frames, nothing is read back, and the CPU's entire contribution is
 * one uniform and one instanced draw call. Ten emitters of two hundred
 * particles each cost ten draw calls and no per-particle work at all.
 *
 * The cost of statelessness is that particles cannot collide, cannot be
 * spawned in bursts and cannot outlive their emitter. For fire on the end of
 * a staff, none of that is a loss: it is a loop that has always been burning
 * and always will be.
 *
 * The geometry is one quad, turned to face the camera in the vertex shader.
 * Drawn additively with depth writes off, so overlapping particles brighten
 * each other and nothing is hidden behind the ones in front of it.
